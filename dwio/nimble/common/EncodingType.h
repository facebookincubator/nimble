// numbers are because of +/-0.0 ( +0.0 == -0.0 but their sign bits are
// different), and NaNs can have different payload bits but even if NaNs
// with the same bits, == will return false, that causes trouble for encoding.
// So they will be treated as integers during encoding (their type will
// still be encoded as double/float)
