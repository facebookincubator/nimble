/// This utility examines the ScanSpec and index column names to extract filters
/// that can be converted to IndexBounds for efficient index-based pruning.
/// Filters that are fully captured by the index bounds are removed from the
/// ScanSpec directly.
///
/// IMPORTANT: The index columns provided can be a prefix of the file's index
/// columns. For example, if the file has index columns [A, B, C], you can pass
/// [A] or [A, B] to create bounds for prefix scans. The filters must still form
/// a prefix of the provided index columns.
///
/// For example, with provided index columns [A, B, C]:
/// - Filter on A only: valid, creates bounds for A
/// - Filters on A and B: valid, creates bounds for A and B
/// - Filters on A, B, and C: valid, creates bounds for all
/// - Filter on B only: invalid, cannot skip A (returns empty)
/// - Filters on A and C: creates bounds for A only (stops at missing B)
///
/// Sort Order Handling:
/// For DESC columns, the bounds are inverted when creating index bounds:
/// - Filter "x >= 10" on DESC column becomes upper bound (values decrease)
/// - Filter "x <= 100" on DESC column becomes lower bound (values decrease)
/// This ensures correct range scanning regardless of column sort order.
///
/// Supported filter types:
/// - kBigintRange: Integer range filters (e.g., x >= 10 AND x <= 100)
/// - kDoubleRange: Double range filters
/// - kFloatRange: Float range filters
/// - kBytesRange: String/bytes range filters
/// - kBytesValues: String/bytes values filter (single value only)
/// - kBoolValue: Boolean filters
/// - kTimestampRange: Timestamp range filters
///
/// @param indexColumns Ordered list of index column names. Can be a prefix of
///        the file's index columns. Must be in index definition order.
/// @param sortOrders Sort order for each index column. Must have the same size
///        as indexColumns.
/// @param rowType The row type containing column type information.
/// @param scanSpec The ScanSpec containing column filters. Filters that are
///        fully captured by the index bounds will be removed from this
///        ScanSpec.
/// @param pool Memory pool for allocations.
/// @return The result containing the converted IndexBounds and the removed
///         filters if filters can be converted, std::nullopt otherwise.
